# Digit-Recognition

Overview

This project implements a Digit Recognition System using machine learning techniques. The model is trained to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, leveraging Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.

Features

Preprocessing: Image normalization and augmentation for better model accuracy.
Deep Learning Model: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction.
Training & Evaluation: Optimized using various activation functions and optimizers.
Real-Time Prediction: Can recognize handwritten digits using live input from a webcam.

Technologies Used 

Python
TensorFlow & Keras
OpenCV
NumPy & Pandas
Matplotlib for visualization
